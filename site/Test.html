	<h2>The iPhone SE is Dead</h2>
	<p class="justification">the reason for the death is the price which is $499 very horrible price that you get a phone 4x the power of the SE for $200 and even less than that.</p>
	<p class="effect">and lets not forget the horrible IOS experience and i hated the iPhone 5s for it's horrible battery life can't even last a 6 hours usage with full charge</p>
